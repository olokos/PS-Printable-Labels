iSocom92's choice:
(This is a bit smaller to the sides and to the top, but I follow 3.65cm for now, this prevents sticking the sticker outside of the concave place on the MCs)
1.437 inches = 3.64998 cm
0.687 inches = 1.74498 cm
3.65cmx1.75cm - Which is the size I used with this printout document

Berion's choice:
3.8cmx1.8cm at 300DPI

HWNJ/Chelsea's choice:
427x224pixels at 300 DPI

Noxillio's choice:
3.8cmx1.9cm at 300 DPI

Instructables choice:
(This seems to be the maximum size of the place for the label)
Top:
W = 38mm (449px @300dpi)
H = 19mm (224px @ 300dpi)

Side
W = 30mm (366px @ 300dpi)
H = 4mm (47px @ 300dpi)

I have noted down all of the dimensions, so everybody can choose whichever they prefer and adjust themselves before printing.

For this printout, I decided to already create 2 versions:
V3 Width 36.5mm - keep original height aspect ratio while rescaling
V4 Width 38mm - keep original height aspect ratio while rescaling

36.5mm when cut will have a little bit of space around the label, so You don't have to be very precise when applying it.
38mm will usually be just right or a bit too big, try it on top of the MC before cutting with scissors, as it might require cutting a bit of the label itself to fit perfectly.

V5 keeps the 38mm width scale
