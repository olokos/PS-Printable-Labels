This is the first release of the Playstation Label collection V3 and V4.

Labelling the MCs with a piece of paper and tape works, but gets really annoying with time. I decided to just buy a sheet of A4 paper (readily available in photocopy points and similar for cheap) and print some labels for my own MC's.

I have tried collecting all of the label images available in the internet, some more some less available, since there's the entire A4 page to print, there's little reason to just print a few labels and waste entire page.

I have marked each label with their author below (in case I made a mistake, let me know), I edited one of the labels for my specific needs, I still did not create them, just slapped some letters on them, so I marked it as "edited by: olokos" since I didn't really create it.


More info:
The only difference between V3 and V4 is slightly different scaling of each label.
V3 = 36.5mm = 1.43700787 inches
V4 = 38mm = 1.49606299 inches

36.5/38mm is the width of the sticker, but keeping the original aspect ratio of the image. That's why some labels might be a bit different height from the others, but all of them stick to the same width.

This release contains V3 and V4 in both docx and PDF version.
All 4 variants are aligned and ready to print.
docx allows others to modify the template to their needs and PDF ensures that it can be opened and printed even from a smartwatch.


Do You like this project?
Please do share Your own images for PS1/PS2 Memory stickers! 
I've seen a lot of cool ones out there on reddit, but none of them actually provided any png's to print them, so in case You have some more, I might just include it in an update to this collection.

In case You made Your own version based on this template, please do share it with others aswell! :)
